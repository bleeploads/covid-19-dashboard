# WHO COVID-19 Dashboard

This project is namely used to display competency in Tableau. OWID's [COVID-19](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) data from 19 January 2020 - 2 January 2022 is used for this analysis. SQL Server was used for data processing before importing to Tableau to create the dashboard.

The dashboard showcases metrics such as Total Deaths, Total Cases, COVID-19 Deaths as a % of the Population, and a geographic heatmap. As well as infection trends through the months, and a forecast until June 2022.
